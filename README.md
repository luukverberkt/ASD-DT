# ASD-DT
Development for the Advanced Software Development course.

## Assessment-Driven Course Development
This course is developed with the methodology 
[Assessment Driven Course Development][adcd] (**ADCD**). ADCD ensures

> constructive alignment, a learning outcome oriented course design, and a clearly stated and communicated list of assessment criteria.

ADCD can be seen as a form of backwards driven course development, first defining what to achieve, then how to assess those achievements and finally the methods for these assessments.

## Learning Outcomes
In order to have constructive alignment, i.e. 

> authentic assessment activities by defining your *learning outcomes* and then creating your assessment method in relation to them.

learning outcomes need to be defined. You will find the learning outcomes in the file [`learning-outcomes.md`][learning-outcomes]
