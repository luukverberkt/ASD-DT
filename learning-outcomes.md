# Learning Outcomes
> Set clear and measurable learning outcomes to help students organize their study and to ensure that you capture all of the elements that you need to teach and assess.

## Template
We use the following template in defining our learning outcomes.

|-------|---------------------------|
| What? | Goals and outcome.        |
| How?  | Method, tools, content    |
| Why?  | The rational for the what |
